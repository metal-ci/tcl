# Overview

This library makes binding tcl & C++ easy, while not hiding the Tcl api.
It is meant as a utility to reduce the boilerplate of tcl-bindings, not as a wrapper.

## Why TCL?

Tcl is a unique combination of a full script language with a command language.
You can execute other programs with `tclsh`, like this:

```tcl
g++ hello_world.cpp
```

while at the same time load and execute arbitrary C or C++ code, e.g.:

```tcl
load ./libbuildhelpers[info sharedlibextension]

g++ [list-sources]
```

where `list-sources` is a command defined in C++.

Since tcl can be embedded in C++ as well, it is also a great starting point for interactive console applications;
and because of the syntax it can be used to create DSLs that do not look and feel like Tcl.
`redis` and `sqlite` started out that way.
